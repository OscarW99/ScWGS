# ScWGS
### A WGS bioinformatics pipeline for validating CRISPR edits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
<br />

Genomic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has many applications from studying cellular function to producing synthetic chemicals. With the decreasing cost of sequencing, it is feasible to use whole genome sequencing for routine validation of engineered yeast strains. ScWGS is a bioinformatics pipeline for analysing yeast whole genome sequencing data. The pipeline takes paired-end, short-read data and combines several open-source bioinformatics tools to discover variants between query and refernce haploid yeast genomes. ScWGS is packaged into a Docker container and all code is available in this repository. <br />
